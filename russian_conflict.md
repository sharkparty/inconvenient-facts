After putin seized Crimea, Obama put sanctions on Russia. Trump promptly got rid of those sanctions for his buddy, then declared that Crimea belonged to Russia, recognizing the legitimacy of their invasion.: [Trump Told G7 Leaders That Crimea Is Russian](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/trump-russia-crimea)

Russia keeps creeping advancing the border with Georgia. They just literally move fences and markers at night and take land a few hundred meters at a time. This happened during Trump's administration. Trump did nothing. ([Source](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2019/02/05/russias-new-strategy-in-georgia-creeping-occupation/))

Belarus, which is a puppet for Putin, as he wants Ukraine to be, is run by his puppet dictator Lukashenko. Lukashenko won a clearly rigged election in 2020, leading to mass protests. A similar situation happened in Ukraine during Obama's administration, and we backed the protests and they ousted Yanukovych, and Ukraine was able to elect a free government that wasn't Putins puppet. So when a similar situation arises while Trump was president, guess what we did?

Guess who ran Putin's puppet, Yanukovych's campaign in ukraine... Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. Then they become Trump's campaign manager and deputy campaign manager. [How Paul Manafort Helped Elect Russia's Man in Ukraine](https://time.com/5003623/paul-manafort-mueller-indictment-ukraine-russia/)

Manafort then pleads guilty to "Conspiracy against the United States." Yes Trump's presidential campaign manager, a Putin-puppet enabler in Ukraine, comes to America, helps Trump get elected, then is imprisoned for Conspiracy against the United States for collaborating with a foreign government (guess which one).

Putin invades Ukraine, Trump praises him, while also thinking the US helped them by sending an amphibious attack on Ukraine, and only thinks its wrong because Biden let people find out about it.

He's a putin puppet. Putin had a puppet president of the US. And you're breaking your back defending him. Putin was doing the same shit during Trump, he just trusted that idiots wouldn't hear about it because he helped teach Trump how to sell morons propaganda. He was banking on his puppet winning again, so they could control the discourse like thy did with Trump in office, but true patriots stopped that, so he did what he would have done anyway without manufactured approval from the republican/Russian supporters/spies of america.
