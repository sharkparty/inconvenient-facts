## Concrete reasons for being removed from office

- Withholding $400M in foreign aid to Ukraine in order to blackmail the Ukrainian president into launching an investigation into Trump's main political opponent, Joe Biden, for reasons that were already thoroughly debunked and known to be debunked by Trump at the time.

  - Impeached by the House of Representatives. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html)

- It is illegal to ask for foreign aid in an election. In an incredibly bold act of stupidity, Trump asked China to investigate the Bidens while on live television. The difference between this and Ukraine is that we are not withholding $400M in military aid to China just because they aren't launching an illegitimate investigation into Trump's political rival.

##  Why he shouldn't be a president

- Trumps own opinion: 
  - > When asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton winning the election, he said that being a president while being under criminal investigation would make it 'impossible for her to govern'. Trump has been under investigation for most of his presidency, and it seems he was right about not being able to govern while under investigation.

- Signs of dementia:
  - The nuclear rant (a timeless classic in my opinion):
  - > “Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”
  - The windmill rant (my current favorite):
  - > "We’ll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I’ve studied it better than anybody. I know it’s very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly — very few made here, almost none. But they’re manufactured tremendous — if you’re into this — tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint — fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it’s in China, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything — right? So they make these things and then they put them up."

- The "Grab em by the pussy" quote:
  - > "I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything." [Source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/donald_trump_2005_tape_i_grab_women_by_the_pussy.html)

- "I like people who weren't captured", when talking about American prisoners of war. Pretty rich coming from the guy was got deferred from the draft 5 times (some deferments were due to being a student, others were from having a "bone spur"). [Source](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317)

  - An extra note on that last one. General Mattis (retired) made a great joke about Trumps bone spur draft dodging: "I got my spurs on the battlefield, Trump got his from a doctor's note".

## Economic Ignorance

- Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  
  - > This is a HUGE failure on behalf of Trump and his administration. When we pulled out of the TPP, China began leading their own talks of a new trade partnership in the pacific... without the US. It was an absolutely stupid move on Trump's part and I don't know how he didn't see that coming, considering he's such a great* businessman and all.  [Source](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/23/trump-pull-out-trans-pacific-partnership)

- Launching a trade war with China (and our EU friends too) and failing to get a single one of his stated goals acheived.
  - > "More in general the results of this paper point to the fact that the United States tariffs on China are economically hurting both countries. United States losses are largely related to the higher prices for consumers, while China’s losses are related to significant export losses."

  - Obama actually owns the biggest contribution to unemployment in the last two decades because his administration brought unemployment from ~10% to ~4% (-6% change) while Trump brought unemployment from ~4% to ~3.6% (-0.4% change).

- Used his office to enrich himself, solicited bribes, and inflicted human rights abuses on migrant families. "President Trump has tried to use the presidency to enrich himself by promoting his businesses as extensions of his administration. That includes conducting government business at them, praising them in his official capacity, and even going so far as to offer exclusive perks to members of his clubs including access to government leaders, influence on government business, and in some cases, appointments to government positions."

  - In an Adam Davidson article entitled "Donald Trump's Worst Deal". Davidson demonstrates how:
    - Donald Trump knowingly laundered money for Iran's Revolutionary Guard for the entire duration of the 2016 campaign.
    - He did so for the specific branch of the IRGC tasked with acquiring missile guidance systems for ICBMs to enable nuclear strikes against American cities.
    - There were extensive media reports that the project was an IRGC money laundering front, and even with lavish spending in the US to find business partners, the Trump Organization was the only American company scummy and desperate enough to sign up as a licensing front.
    - The Trump Organization openly acknowledges everything. They knew they were too much of a rinky dink operation to be prosecuted at the time, and now that Trump is President they are beyond the law.
    - This project made Donald Trump the chief US collaborator with Solomeini in his pursuit of a nuclear ICBM program.
    - Soleimani assigned the task of acquiring ICBM components to his close ally Mohamed Ghalibaf.
    - Ghalibaf's two top deputies, the Darvishi brothers, set up it's most successful front company in collaboration with Azerbaijan's minister of transport, Ziya Mammadov.
    - Mammadov spent lavishly across the US looking for business partners, but no one was biting because it was well known they were laundering money for the IRGC. The only American who was willing to partner with him was Donald Trump.

  - **April 25th**: Joe Biden announced his candidacy for President, immediately securing a commanding lead.
  - **Early May**: 1-2 weeks later, a plan to rig the election against him was put into motion. Conducted by Giuliani and, now acknowledged to be directed by Trump, who immediately looped in his National Security Advisor, Chief of Staff, and Chief Legal Counsel. The original reporting [from NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/trump-bolton-ukraine.html) on Bolton's manuscript:
    - > President Trump directed John R. Bolton, then his national security adviser, to help with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on Democrats from Ukrainian officials, according to an unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton....Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president’s impeachment defense.
  - **May 9th**: Giuliani acknowledges his activities in Ukraine to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/giuliani-ukraine-trump.html):
    - > “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,. There’s nothing illegal about it,” he said. “Somebody could say it’s improper. And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop.

  - Bolton's manuscript goes on to show that Trump was directing this scheme in detail through staff other that Giuliani, and was attempting to extort Zelensky from the get go:
  - > Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani:
  - **May 10th**: Giuliani sends [a letter](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20200114_-_hpsci_transmittal_letter_to_hjc_-_new_evidence.pdf) to Zelensky asserting that Trump had explicit "knowledge and consent" of his efforts. Mr. Parnas’ phone included a screenshot of a previously-undisclosed May 10, 2019, letter from Mr. Giuliani to then-President-elect Zelensky. The one-page letter signed by Mr. Giuliani states, in part:
    - > Dear President-Elect Zelensky:
    I am private counsel to President Donald J. Trump. Just to be precise, I represent him as a private citizen, not as President of the United States. This is quite common under American law because the duties and privileges of a President and a private citizen are not the same. Separate representation is usual process.
    […]
    However, I have a more specific request. **In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent**, I request a meeting with you on this upcoming Monday, May 13th or Tuesday, May 14th. I will need no more than a half-hour of your time and I will be accompanied by my colleague Victoria Toensing, a distinguished American attorney who is very familiar with this matter.
  - Mr. Parnas texted a copy of the letter to a close aide to then-President-elect Zelensky shortly after it was drafted.
  - Mr. Giuliani’s letter makes clear that his trip, which he publicly described at the time as an effort to “meddle in an investigation,” was undertaken with the knowledge and support of President Trump.
  - Now that impeachment is over, Bolton and Giuliani never even having been called as a witnesses, Trump feels comfortable admitting everything. Because this interview is a flex. Because the ultimate defense of his actions is always the same: "Fuck you. I can do whatever I want".

    - Trade with Europe
      - During his Oval Office address to the nation about the coronavirus on March 11, Trump, speaking from a script, announced that he was imposing restrictions on travel from Europe -- and then added that "these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing."
      - As he was forced to explain on Twitter after the speech, he was not actually banning trade and cargo from Europe. [(Source)](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237924658185469954?s=)
    - Handshakes in India
      - While meeting with the prime minister of Ireland on March 12, Trump was asked whether he was fine shaking hands with foreign prime ministers. Trump said they hadn't shaken hands that day -- then added, "You know, I just got back from India, and I didn't shake any hands there."
      - An Indian news website promptly published a photo gallery of seven Trump handshakes during his trip. [(Source)](https://theprint.in/in-pictures/donald-trump-said-he-did-not-shake-hands-with-anyone-in-india-thats-not-true/380650/)

      - Experts said the US did not have the virus even close to under control. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at this same briefing after Trump left the room: "The worst is, yes, ahead for us. It is how we respond to that challenge that's going to determine what the ultimate end point is going to be. We have a very, very critical point now."
    - Obama, the coronavirus and swine flu
      - > "If you go back and look at the swine flu and what happened with the swine flu, you'll see how many people died and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time, as people were dying all over the place." [(Source)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference-3/)

      - On April 26, 2009, less than two weeks after the first US cases of H1N1 were confirmed, the Obama administration [declared](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/idcu/disease/influenza/surveillance/2010/) a public health emergency. Two days later, the Obama administration made an initial $1.5 billion [funding](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa-cases-sb/obama-seeks-1-5-billion-for-swine-flu-as-cases-jump-idUSWAT01136620090429) request to Congress. (Congress ultimately [allocated](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2009/06/congress-approves-765-billion-pandemic-flu-response) $7.7 billion). That same day, April 28, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention test was cleared for use. The CDC began shipping tests across the US and around the world on May 1. Between April 23 and May 31, the CDC says its influenza laboratory analyzed about 5,000 samples. In October, Obama [declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/politics/25flu.html) a national emergency to allow hospitals more flexibility for a possible flood of H1N1 patients.
    - Flu deaths in 1990
      - "You know, three, four weeks ago, I said, 'Well, how many people die a year from the flu?' And, in this country, I think last year was 36- or 37,000 people. And I'm saying, 'Wow, nobody knew that information.'" [(Source)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-meeting-pharmaceutical-companies/)
      - Trump might not have known the number of annual flu deaths in the US, but that doesn't mean "nobody" else did. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes annual estimates on its [website](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html).
      - Speaking about the flu, Trump said, "I think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity [(Source)](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-interview-sean-hannity-fox-telephone-march-4-2020)
      - While the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the CDC declared that it was an [epidemic](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/26/us/us-health-agency-declares-flu-epidemic.html) -- Trump greatly overstated the number of deaths. A CDC analysis in 2010 [estimated](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5933a1.htm) that there were 26,582 deaths from the seasonal flu in 1989-1990.
    - Polling on Trump and the coronavirus
      - "Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation." -- March 5 [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1235665090432708608?s=20)
      - "Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record." -- March 12 [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238288908431036423?s=20)
      - Trump may have been wrongly describing a Gallup poll conducted in early-to-mid-February -- before there were any reported US deaths from the coronavirus -- that found 77% of respondents had confidence in the federal government to handle a coronavirus outbreak. But that poll asked about confidence in the government's future acts, not about approval of its actual work to date. It also did not ask about Trump in particular.

    - Travel from Europe
      - "To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days...There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings...These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom." -- March 11 Oval Office address to the nation on the coronavirus
      - His travel suspension did not apply to "all travel from Europe"; it applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders. (Trump later added the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are not in the Schengen Area, to the restricted list.)

    - A "rally" in Tampa
      - Talking about how his campaign has canceled rallies because of the coronavirus, Trump said, "And we had four or five of them that we were thinking about. We have a big one in Tampa, all sold out. We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we'll probably not do it because people would say it's better to not do." -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar [(Source)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-prime-minister-varadkar-ireland-bilateral-meeting-3/?utm_source=link)
      - There was no "sold out" Trump rally in Tampa, Florida. While Trump's campaign was in the process of planning a Tampa rally [(Source)](https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1238135132499910657), the event had not been publicly announced [(Source)](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1238121348741955589) and no tickets had been publicly offered, so it simply does not make sense that the event was "sold out" or that there had been "over 100,000 requests for tickets." The Associated Press reported that Trump's claim was "an impossibility" and that the campaign had declined to comment; the campaign also did not respond to our inquiry.
    - Google's coronavirus website
      - "I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who's a great gentleman, said -- called us and he apologized. I don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace...And how that got out -- and I'm sure you'll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful." -- March 15 coronavirus press conference
      - The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it won't happen. More importantly, thank you to Google!" -- March 15 tweet [(Source)](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239252169150410752?s=20)
      - Google declined to comment on the substance of any call between CEO Sundar Pichai and the Trump team, but it's not true that the press did not call Google or that the press reported "fake news" about Trump's announcement that Google was helping to develop a coronavirus website, to be completed "very quickly," that would "determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location." Journalists contacted Google and accurately reported the company's initial response, which made clear that Trump had exaggerated.

      - There had not been any New York deaths attributed to the coronavirus at the time. (The first two deaths in the state were announced on March 14, 10 days after Trump spoke here.) [(Source)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/nyregion/coronavirus-ny.html#link-18dbab45)
    - The coronavirus situation in Italy
      - "...I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy." -- March 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      - The number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in Italy was continuing to increase at the time Trump made this comment. As of Saturday, March 7, the day after Trump spoke here, Italy had 5,883 confirmed cases and 233 deaths; as of Monday, March 9, there were 9,172 cases and 463 deaths.
    - A remark by Nancy Pelosi
      - "Nancy Pelosi just said, 'I don't know if we can be ready this week.' In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!" -- March 10 tweet [(Source)](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237388340778782725?s=20)
      - Democrats were not going away on vacation, and Pelosi was not suggesting they were. Asked on Monday, March 9 if her goal was to have the House pass a coronavirus relief bill "this week," Pelosi said, "I don't know that we can be ready this week, but we can introduce this week, we can introduce it and we may be ready this week, depending on CBO (Congressional Budget Office), depending on (the House Office of the Legislative Counsel) and how quickly they can get something back to us." [(Source)](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/3920-0)
      - The House ended up passing the bill early in the morning of Saturday, March 14.
    - Trump's student loan plan
      - Amazing how the Fake News never covers this. No Interest on Student Loans. The Dems are just talk!" -- March 15 tweet [(Source)](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239201055315025920?s=20)
      - Numerous media outlets, including [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/trump-federal-student-loan-interest-coronavirus/index.html), reported on Trump's announcement that he had "waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies, and that will be until further notice." (Outlets noted that [the administration had not immediately provided important details of the plan](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/17/trump-promised-waive-student-loan-interest-its-unclear-if-borrowers-will-see-any) and that [borrowers might not see a reduction in their current monthly payments](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/politics/student-loan-interest-waiver-coronavirus/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_content=2020-03-18T13%3A01%3A04&utm_term=image&utm_source=twCNNp), but they were indeed [covering](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-administration-student-loan-payments-suspension-128181) the announcement.)
    - Border closures
      - "In a certain way, you could say that the borders are automatically shut down, without having to say 'shut down.' I mean, they're, to a certain extent, automatically shut down. But it's affecting the airline business, as it would." And: "And we have closed down certain sections of the world, frankly, and they've sort of automatically closed them also." -- March 4 remarks at briefing with airline executives [(Source)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-coronavirus-briefing-airline-ceos/)
      - Trump did not explain what he meant by "the borders are automatically shut down." His travel restrictions at the time, on China and Iran, did not constitute complete closures of the border; they make exceptions for American citizens, permanent residents and some of their family members. [(Source)](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/fact-check-trump-administration-coronavirus-28-dishonest/index.html)
    - The Europe restrictions and testing
      - When a reporter noted that an American could bring back the coronavirus even with Trump's new travel restrictions on some European countries, Trump said, "Sure. But we have them very heavily tested. If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back, we're testing. We have a tremendous testing set up where people coming in have to be tested." -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar [(Source)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-prime-minister-varadkar-ireland-bilateral-meeting-3/?utm_source=link)
      - It's not true that Americans or others returning from Europe "have to be" tested for the coronavirus -- and no system is being set up to actually test these returning travelers.

### My Own Theories

- Trump uses drastic tactics that often come at the expense of the lives of non-Americans to avoid facing challenges at home.
  - Trump abandons the Kurds to distract the press from his impeachment
    - On the evening of September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced that six committees of the House of Representatives would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
    - In an October 8, 2019 letter to House Democratic leaders, the White House stated it would not cooperate with "[their] partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances." [(Source)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/sondland-trump-ukraine-impeach.html) The eight-page letter was widely interpreted by legal analysts as containing political rather than legal arguments.

  - Did we assassinate a foreign national merely to sidestep the leaks of his emails showing that he was solely responsible for witholding the aid to Ukraine, which is a violation of the Impoundments Act, and to prevent the news from covering the fact that his goons were working overtime to prevent witnesses in the impeachment trial?
    - Friday, December 20, 2019 - Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated Thursday that she would delay sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, seeking more clarity on the rules for President Trump’s trial and potentially pushing the proceedings well into the new year.

      - >Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with “no pressure.” She said it must be “bipartisan & overwhelming,” but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also, very unfair with no Due Process, proper representation, or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!

      - It's worth clarifying that there is no requirement of an Impeachment trial that it's bipartisan. It's also not a criminal case, it's an impeachment trial and is an entirely different process.

      - As well, he absolutely did violate the Impoundments Act, and republicans could give a shit [(Source)](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/dec/05/did-trump-violate-impoundment-control-act/) Also, for a source on Republicans not giving a shit, just ask one. They won't know about this act, why it was enacted, for which president we passed this law, the irony of what's happening now given that background, and even when confronted with all of that, they'll simply grab you by the pussy, scream MAGA, set an ethnic minority on fire, while hating on Thunberg's absolutely insane agenda to keep the earth from being destroyed, and claiming that anyone that oposes Trump just wants to harvest organs from babies to keep Hillary Clinton alive forever because she's our savior.

    - Thereafter, all discussions on having witnesses dissapeared from news outlets as they were covering another Trump media blitz. Did we assassinate a foreign national—in an of itself an act of war and a strident display of Trump's abuse of power—solely to protect Trump from having witnesses at his trial?
