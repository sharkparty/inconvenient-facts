## Concrete reasons for being removed from office

- Withholding $400M in foreign aid to Ukraine in order to blackmail the Ukrainian president into launching an investigation into Trump's main political opponent, Joe Biden, for reasons that were already thoroughly debunked and known to be debunked by Trump at the time.

  - Impeached by the House of Representatives. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html)

- It is illegal to ask for foreign aid in an election. In an incredibly bold act of stupidity, Trump asked China to investigate the Bidens while on live television. The difference between this and Ukraine is that we are not withholding $400M in military aid to China just because they aren't launching an illegitimate investigation into Trump's political rival.

##  Why he shouldn't be a president

- Trumps own opinion: 
  - > When asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton winning the election, he said that being a president while being under criminal investigation would make it 'impossible for her to govern'. Trump has been under investigation for most of his presidency, and it seems he was right about not being able to govern while under investigation.

- Signs of dementia:
  - The nuclear rant (a timeless classic in my opinion):
  - > “Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”
  - The windmill rant (my current favorite):
  - > "We’ll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I’ve studied it better than anybody. I know it’s very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly — very few made here, almost none. But they’re manufactured tremendous — if you’re into this — tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint — fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it’s in China, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything — right? So they make these things and then they put them up."

- The "Grab em by the pussy" quote:
  - > "I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything." [Source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/donald_trump_2005_tape_i_grab_women_by_the_pussy.html)

- "I like people who weren't captured", when talking about American prisoners of war. Pretty rich coming from the guy was got deferred from the draft 5 times (some deferments were due to being a student, others were from having a "bone spur"). [Source](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317)

  - An extra note on that last one. General Mattis (retired) made a great joke about Trumps bone spur draft dodging: "I got my spurs on the battlefield, Trump got his from a doctor's note".

## Economic Ignorance

- Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  
  - > This is a HUGE failure on behalf of Trump and his administration. When we pulled out of the TPP, China began leading their own talks of a new trade partnership in the pacific... without the US. It was an absolutely stupid move on Trump's part and I don't know how he didn't see that coming, considering he's such a great* businessman and all.  [Source](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/23/trump-pull-out-trans-pacific-partnership)

- Launching a trade war with China (and our EU friends too) and failing to get a single one of his stated goals acheived.
  - > "More in general the results of this paper point to the fact that the United States tariffs on China are economically hurting both countries. United States losses are largely related to the higher prices for consumers, while China’s losses are related to significant export losses."

  - Obama actually owns the biggest contribution to unemployment in the last two decades because his administration brought unemployment from ~10% to ~4% (-6% change) while Trump brought unemployment from ~4% to ~3.6% (-0.4% change).

- Used his office to enrich himself, solicited bribes, and inflicted human rights abuses on migrant families. "President Trump has tried to use the presidency to enrich himself by promoting his businesses as extensions of his administration. That includes conducting government business at them, praising them in his official capacity, and even going so far as to offer exclusive perks to members of his clubs including access to government leaders, influence on government business, and in some cases, appointments to government positions."

  - In an Adam Davidson article entitled "Donald Trump's Worst Deal". Davidson demonstrates how:
    - Donald Trump knowingly laundered money for Iran's Revolutionary Guard for the entire duration of the 2016 campaign.
    - He did so for the specific branch of the IRGC tasked with acquiring missile guidance systems for ICBMs to enable nuclear strikes against American cities.
    - There were extensive media reports that the project was an IRGC money laundering front, and even with lavish spending in the US to find business partners, the Trump Organization was the only American company scummy and desperate enough to sign up as a licensing front.
    - The Trump Organization openly acknowledges everything. They knew they were too much of a rinky dink operation to be prosecuted at the time, and now that Trump is President they are beyond the law.
    - This project made Donald Trump the chief US collaborator with Solomeini in his pursuit of a nuclear ICBM program.
    - Soleimani assigned the task of acquiring ICBM components to his close ally Mohamed Ghalibaf.
    - Ghalibaf's two top deputies, the Darvishi brothers, set up it's most successful front company in collaboration with Azerbaijan's minister of transport, Ziya Mammadov.
    - Mammadov spent lavishly across the US looking for business partners, but no one was biting because it was well known they were laundering money for the IRGC. The only American who was willing to partner with him was Donald Trump.

  - **April 25th**: Joe Biden announced his candidacy for President, immediately securing a commanding lead.
  - **Early May**: 1-2 weeks later, a plan to rig the election against him was put into motion. Conducted by Giuliani and, now acknowledged to be directed by Trump, who immediately looped in his National Security Advisor, Chief of Staff, and Chief Legal Counsel. The original reporting [from NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/trump-bolton-ukraine.html) on Bolton's manuscript:
    - > President Trump directed John R. Bolton, then his national security adviser, to help with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on Democrats from Ukrainian officials, according to an unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton....Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president’s impeachment defense.
  - **May 9th**: Giuliani acknowledges his activities in Ukraine to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/giuliani-ukraine-trump.html):
    - > “We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,. There’s nothing illegal about it,” he said. “Somebody could say it’s improper. And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”
  - Bolton's manuscript goes on to show that Trump was directing this scheme in detail through staff other that Giuliani, and was attempting to extort Zelensky from the get go:
  - > Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani:
  - **May 10th**: Giuliani sends [a letter](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20200114_-_hpsci_transmittal_letter_to_hjc_-_new_evidence.pdf) to Zelensky asserting that Trump had explicit "knowledge and consent" of his efforts. Mr. Parnas’ phone included a screenshot of a previously-undisclosed May 10, 2019, letter from Mr. Giuliani to then-President-elect Zelensky. The one-page letter signed by Mr. Giuliani states, in part:
    - > Dear President-Elect Zelensky:
    I am private counsel to President Donald J. Trump. Just to be precise, I represent him as a private citizen, not as President of the United States. This is quite common under American law because the duties and privileges of a President and a private citizen are not the same. Separate representation is usual process.
    […]
    However, I have a more specific request. **In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent**, I request a meeting with you on this upcoming Monday, May 13th or Tuesday, May 14th. I will need no more than a half-hour of your time and I will be accompanied by my colleague Victoria Toensing, a distinguished American attorney who is very familiar with this matter.
  - Mr. Parnas texted a copy of the letter to a close aide to then-President-elect Zelensky shortly after it was drafted.
  - Mr. Giuliani’s letter makes clear that his trip, which he publicly described at the time as an effort to “meddle in an investigation,” was undertaken with the knowledge and support of President Trump.
  - Now that impeachment is over, Bolton and Giuliani never even having been called as a witnesses, Trump feels comfortable admitting everything. Because this interview is a flex. Because the ultimate defense of his actions is always the same: "Fuck you. I can do whatever I want".

     - This is a good way to contextualize it:
     - The regular fly has a mortality rate of 0.1% [(Source)](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020). Swine flu has a mortality rate of 0.02% [(Source)](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/01/study-puts-global-2009-pandemic-h1n1-infection-rate-24), meaning the regular flu was 5x more deadly than the swine flu. The reported numbers have coronavirus at 3.4% [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404), making it 170x more deadly than Swine Flu. Even if there are 3-4x the number of unreported cases of people who don't die from it(meaning an effective ~1% mortality), that means that coronavirus is still 10x more deadly than the regular flu, and 50x more deadly than Swine Flu.
     - Coronavirus seems to be more contagious as well. The R0 value of a pathogen is the basic reproduction number. R0 is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person, in a population that’s never seen the disease before. If R0 is 3, then on average every case will create three new cases. Swine Flu's R0 value was 1.4-1.6 [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404) and the regular flu is 1.3 [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404) while coronavirus is estimated to range from 2.2-3.4 [(Source)](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/updated-information-on-covid-19-what-can-you-do-to-protect-against-coronavirus) while some studies have it as high as 4.7-6.6 [(Source)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1).

### My Own Theories

- Trump uses drastic tactics that often come at the expense of the lives of non-Americans to avoid facing challenges at home.
  - Trump abandons the Kurds to distract the press from his impeachment
    - On the evening of September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced that six committees of the House of Representatives would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump.
    - In an October 8, 2019 letter to House Democratic leaders, the White House stated it would not cooperate with "[their] partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances." [(Source)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/sondland-trump-ukraine-impeach.html) The eight-page letter was widely interpreted by legal analysts as containing political rather than legal arguments.

    - On October 13, 2019 Trump orders a withdrawal of US troops from Syria [(Source)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/us/politics/mark-esper-syria-kurds-turkey.html)
 abandoning the Kurds and freeing a hundred+ ISIS fighters [(Source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/100-isis-prisoners-loose-security-officials-act-now/story?id=66499973)
    - Did we abandon the kurds causing hundreds of deaths [(Source)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-turkey-usa/thousands-flee-hundreds-reported-dead-in-turkish-attack-on-us-allied-kurds-in-syria-idUSKBN1WP0VH) and voiding our international trust [(Source)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/18/trump-can-forget-burden-sharing-now/) in order for Trump to keep news outlets distracted from reporting on his impeachment inquiry?
  - Did we assassinate a foreign national merely to sidestep the leaks of his emails showing that he was solely responsible for witholding the aid to Ukraine, which is a violation of the Impoundments Act, and to prevent the news from covering the fact that his goons were working overtime to prevent witnesses in the impeachment trial?
    - Friday, December 20, 2019 - Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated Thursday that she would delay sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, seeking more clarity on the rules for President Trump’s trial and potentially pushing the proceedings well into the new year. [(Source)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-house-impeaches-trump-timing-of-next-steps-is-unclear-11576755097)
    - On December 21, conservative Bill Kristol and a group calling itself "Republicans for the Rule of Law" released an ad encouraging viewers to call their senators to demand top Trump officials be forced to testify in his impeachment trial [(Source)](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-for-the-rule-of-law-impeachment-witnesses_n_5dfec4afe4b0843d35fd0c00?).
    - Wednesday, December 25th, 2019 - President Trump lashed out on Nancy Pelosi in a pair of tweets Christmas night, decrying what he called a "Scam Impeachment." [(Source)](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/475928-trump-lashes-out-at-pelosi-in-christmas-tweets-decries-scam-impeachment)
      - >Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with “no pressure.” She said it must be “bipartisan & overwhelming,” but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also, very unfair with no Due Process, proper representation, or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!

      - It's worth clarifying that there is no requirement of an Impeachment trial that it's bipartisan. It's also not a criminal case, it's an impeachment trial and is an entirely different process.

    - Thursday, January 2, 2020 - In addition to the witness discussion, an article came out that showed unredacted emails revealed that the order to withhold Ukraine aid came directly from president, report says [(Source)](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-emails-ukraine-aid-schumer-leak-pentagon-a9268391.html). 
      - The president confirmed that he froze the military assistance before reportedly pressing the country’s leader to investigate his political rival. These remarks are at odds with his assertion that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government [(Source)](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/24/donald-trump-ukraine-military-aid-1509070).
      - This further proves that Trump's claims that he did the same thing Obama did when Obama paused aid were in fact false [(Source)](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/minority/fact-check-president-trumps-false-claim-equating-his-illegal-ukraine-aid-freeze-with-president-obamas-lawful-legitimate-pauses-on-aid)
      - As well, he absolutely did violate the Impoundments Act, and republicans could give a shit [(Source)](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/dec/05/did-trump-violate-impoundment-control-act/) Also, for a source on Republicans not giving a shit, just ask one. They won't know about this act, why it was enacted, for which president we passed this law, the irony of what's happening now given that background, and even when confronted with all of that, they'll simply grab you by the pussy, scream MAGA, set an ethnic minority on fire, while hating on Thunberg's absolutely insane agenda to keep the earth from being destroyed, and claiming that anyone that oposes Trump just wants to harvest organs from babies to keep Hillary Clinton alive forever because she's our savior.

    - Thereafter, all discussions on having witnesses dissapeared from news outlets as they were covering another Trump media blitz. Did we assassinate a foreign national—in an of itself an act of war and a strident display of Trump's abuse of power—solely to protect Trump from having witnesses at his trial?
