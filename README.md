## Concrete reasons for being removed from office

- Withholding $400M in foreign aid to Ukraine in order to blackmail the Ukrainian president into launching an investigation into Trump's main political opponent, Joe Biden, for reasons that were already thoroughly debunked and known to be debunked by Trump at the time.

  - Impeached by the House of Representatives. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html)

- It is illegal to ask for foreign aid in an election. In an incredibly bold act of stupidity, Trump asked China to investigate the Bidens while on live television. The difference between this and Ukraine is that we are not withholding $400M in military aid to China just because they aren't launching an illegitimate investigation into Trump's political rival.

- Asking Comey to end the Flynn investigation. This investigation was attempting to ascertain whether there was a link between Russia and Trump's own 2016 campaign. This is abuse of his executive powers and obstruction of justice. [Source](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)

##  Why he shouldn't be a president

- Trumps own opinion: 
  - > When asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton winning the election, he said that being a president while being under criminal investigation would make it 'impossible for her to govern'. Trump has been under investigation for most of his presidency, and it seems he was right about not being able to govern while under investigation.

- Signs of dementia:
  - The nuclear rant (a timeless classic in my opinion):
  - > “Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”
  - The windmill rant (my current favorite):
  - > "We’ll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I’ve studied it better than anybody. I know it’s very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly — very few made here, almost none. But they’re manufactured tremendous — if you’re into this — tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint — fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it’s in China, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything — right? So they make these things and then they put them up."

- The "Grab em by the pussy" quote:
  - > "I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything." [Source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/donald_trump_2005_tape_i_grab_women_by_the_pussy.html)

- "I like people who weren't captured", when talking about American prisoners of war. Pretty rich coming from the guy was got deferred from the draft 5 times (some deferments were due to being a student, others were from having a "bone spur"). [Source](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317)

  - An extra note on that last one. General Mattis (retired) made a great joke about Trumps bone spur draft dodging: "I got my spurs on the battlefield, Trump got his from a doctor's note".

## Economic Ignorance

- Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  
  - > This is a HUGE failure on behalf of Trump and his administration. When we pulled out of the TPP, China began leading their own talks of a new trade partnership in the pacific... without the US. It was an absolutely stupid move on Trump's part and I don't know how he didn't see that coming, considering he's such a great* businessman and all.  [Source](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/23/trump-pull-out-trans-pacific-partnership)

- Launching a trade war with China (and our EU friends too).
  - > "More in general the results of this paper point to the fact that the United States tariffs on China are economically hurting both countries. United States losses are largely related to the higher prices for consumers, while China’s losses are related to significant export losses."
  - Trump's trade war has directly hurt US consumers based on this report from the United Nations. [Source](https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ser-rp-2019d9_en.pdf)

- Supported by a shady network of attorneys linked to the mob in NY City and Russian Oligarchs known to launder money through real estate. [Mafia connections](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910), [Russian Connections EX. 1](https://swalwell.house.gov/issues/russia-trump-his-administration-s-ties), [Russia Connections EX. 2](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/) "Donald Trump Jr., has appeared to confirm, saying in 2008—after the Trump Organization was prospering again—that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.”"

  - In an Adam Davidson article entitled "Donald Trump's Worst Deal". Davidson demonstrates how:
    - Donald Trump knowingly laundered money for Iran's Revolutionary Guard for the entire duration of the 2016 campaign.
    - He did so for the specific branch of the IRGC tasked with acquiring missile guidance systems for ICBMs to enable nuclear strikes against American cities.
    - There were extensive media reports that the project was an IRGC money laundering front, and even with lavish spending in the US to find business partners, the Trump Organization was the only American company scummy and desperate enough to sign up as a licensing front.
    - The Trump Organization openly acknowledges everything. They knew they were too much of a rinky dink operation to be prosecuted at the time, and now that Trump is President they are beyond the law.
    - This project made Donald Trump the chief US collaborator with Solomeini in his pursuit of a nuclear ICBM program.
    - Soleimani assigned the task of acquiring ICBM components to his close ally Mohamed Ghalibaf.
    - Ghalibaf's two top deputies, the Darvishi brothers, set up it's most successful front company in collaboration with Azerbaijan's minister of transport, Ziya Mammadov.
    - Mammadov spent lavishly across the US looking for business partners, but no one was biting because it was well known they were laundering money for the IRGC. The only American who was willing to partner with him was Donald Trump.

"This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year, while he was president."

- Used his office to enrich himself, solicited bribes, and inflicted human rights abuses on migrant families.
